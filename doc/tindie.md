ALBASE1521 is an aluminum base-board under MLAB modules. The ALBASE1520 has two main purposes. Create a mechanically robust construction that will keep your design safely in the one piece. This eliminates the difficult attachment of incompatible arduino modules into one mechanical unit. Second purpose is common electrical ground. Ground is connected trough screws of individual modules, which ensures a reliable combination of all modules on ALBASE.

The board contains 15x21 holes 3.2 mm (for M3 screws) with a pitch of 400 mills (10.16mm). Along the edges of the board is a series of 3.2 mm holes with metric spacing (10 mm). In addition, the plate contains a three 5.2 mm (M5) holes for vertical assembly of more plates above each other. You can expand your design with the maintenance of the main benefits of ALBASE (mechanical and electrical robustness).
