ALBASE is an aluminum base-board under MLAB modules. The ALBASE has two main purposes. Create a mechanically robust construction that will keep your design safely in the one piece. This eliminates the difficult attachment of incompatible arduino modules into one mechanical unit. Second purpose is common electrical ground. Ground is connected trough screws of individual modules, which ensures a reliable combination of all modules on ALBASE.

In general, ALBASE is manufactured from duralumin with 2mm thickness. Holes in ALBASE board are designed for use with M3 screw. Their diameter is 3.2mm. Pitch of holes is 400 mills (10.16mm). 

### ALBASE is availible in multiple variants:
Select the your variant during adding it into the cart.

## [ALBASE1521](https://github.com/mlab-modules/ALBASE1521)
This board provides you enough space for your complex design.

The board contains 15x21 holes 3.2 mm (for M3 screws) with a pitch of 400 mills (10.16mm). Edges of board are fitted with row of 3.2 mm holes with metric spacing (10 mm). Holes are designed for M3 screw. In addition, the plate contains a three 5.2 mm (M5) holes for vertical assembly of more plates above each other. You can expand your design with the maintenance of the main benefits of ALBASE (mechanical and electrical robustness).

## [ALBASE1521B](https://github.com/mlab-modules/ALBASE1521B)
The ALBASE1521B board has the same dimensions as the previous ALBASE1521 board. However, it is not equipped with a row of metric-spaced holes around its edge, also id does not have holes for M5 screws for board stacking. The feature of this board is that it has one side with holes id distance from the edge of the board, that the edges of modules are aligned with the edge of the board.

## [ALBASE1115](https://github.com/mlab-modules/ALBASE1115)
ALBASE with 11x15 holes. It is useful for small designs with a few modules.
